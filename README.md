# base-screen-component

## Features

- Adds a new option to the context menu when right-clicking on a folder: **Create Screen Component**.
- Allows you to create a base JavaScript/TypeScript file that represents a screen in a mobile application.
- The file name can include folders, which will be created if they donâ€™t exist (e.g., `Carpeta1/Screen/Food`).
- Supports specifying the file extension; if not specified, `.jsx` is used by default.
- Prompts the user to select a snippet to populate the newly created file with predefined content.
- The generated file will follow the format `Filename.folder.ext`, where:
